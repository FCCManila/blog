# REQUIREMENTS

## SKILL & KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENTS
Did we already mention you will need to read a lot? Well then, you absolutely need to read a lot. But learning is not a chore, it's a privilege!

Here is a list of the minimum skills that you will have to know to start working on our particular project:

- ### Proper Behavior
  As contributors, we are bound by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Everyone is expected to strictly abide by it. Please read and understand the Covenant and take it into heart.

- ### Git `THIS IS A MUST!`
  If there is one skill that is an absolute must for every developer, from aspirants to professionals alike, it is Git.

  **We repeat: Git is a must-know.**

  Why, you ask?

  Most programming projects have several developers working on the same codebase. Imagine having to introduce a line of code, only to discover later that it is already incompatible with the codebase. Worse, one may fail to realize the incompatibility of the new line of code that it spawns bugs or even breaks the whole application.

  This is where a version control system (VCS) like Git comes in. Simply put, a VCS helps manage the changes, which usually comes from different sources, in the underlying code of any programming application.

  And hey, Git is the main philosophy behind Github.

- ### Markdown and Proper Writing Techniques `GREAT FOR NEWBIES`
  If you want to contribute articles and documentation, you have to know Markdown.

  Markdown is the least intimidating skill to learn among those listed here. It can be a good starting point for the absolute beginner.

  You will also need to practice good writing. This is not a strict requirement but it is highly encouraged. Being able to communicate clearly is a very useful skill in almost every situation.

- ### HTML, CSS, Javascript `GOOD FOR NEWBIES TOO`
  If you plan on working on the backend and basic front-end UI of the blog, you will need to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Luckily, [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) offers a [curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) especially designed for web development.

- ### React and ES6 `FOR ADVANCED DEVELOPERS`
  If you plan on working on the more advanced front-end functionalities of the blog, you will need to learn React too.

  React is a front-end Javascript library being developed by Facebook. It is easy and fun to work with.

  ES6 is the next generation Javascript that is being used by React. Most believe that ES6 is so much easier than the old Javascript that we have come to know.

- ### Gatsby and Github Integrations `FOR ADVANCED DEVELOPERS`

  Gatsby, a static website generator, is the engine that runs the FCC-Manila Blog. If you plan on introducing sophisticated functionality into the blog, you may want to do it by contributing to the Gatsby project.

  Meanwhile, Github Integrations provides a list of third-party services and plugins, paid and free, that can help manage this project's Github repository better through automation. Tools like [`Travis CI`](https://travis-ci.org/) can be found here.
